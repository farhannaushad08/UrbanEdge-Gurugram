## 🔍 About the Project

**UrbanEdge – Gurugram** is a complete real estate data solution designed to help users explore, understand, and predict property prices in Gurugram. From detailed visual analytics to machine learning predictions and a recommendation engine — this app brings together data science and real estate in an intuitive interface.

It’s built end-to-end: starting from raw data, extensive preprocessing, model development using `RandomForestRegressor` (with pipelines and encoders), to deployment-ready Streamlit apps.
